# springboard_regression_projects

The linear regression mini project uses a Boston Housing Data Set to build linear regression models in Python using scikit-learn and statsmodels. A different amount of variables (univariate, multivariate) are included in several models to predict the price of housing in Boston and the models are compared to one another using their R-squared, F-statistic, and p-value metrics.
