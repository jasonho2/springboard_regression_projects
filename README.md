# springboard_regression_projects

The linear regression mini project uses a Boston Housing Data Set to build linear regression models in Python using scikit-learn and statsmodels. A different amount of variables (univariate, multivariate) are included in several models to predict the price of housing in Boston and the models are compared to one another using their R-squared, F-statistic, and p-value metrics.

The logistic regression mini project uses a dataset of heights and weights for males and females. The model created tries to classify an instance as male or female from the training data of heights and weights of defined males and females. Logistic regression uses probability in the test set as a measure of how accurate the model will perform the classifications.
